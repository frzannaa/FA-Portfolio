# FA Portfolio Website

This is a simple personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. It showcases my profile, skills, and projects.
You can view the site here: [https://your-vercel-link.vercel.app](https://farzana-afifah-git-main-frzannaas-projects.vercel.app/)
> I'm in the process of updating the design and layout to better reflect my skills and personality. New version coming soon!
